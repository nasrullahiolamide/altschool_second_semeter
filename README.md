Here's a sample `README.md` file that will render well on GitHub for your assignment:

---

# Assignment 1

Build two web pages:

1. **Page 1**: This page will be about you, including your ALT SCHOOL ID, biography, and any relevant information, along with the reason why you joined AltSchool. Also, include your goals for the School of Engineering program. Use a fragment identifier and build a feature to scroll to the top with a fragment identifier.

   - **Files**: `index.html`

2. **Page 2**: This is a form that is a replica of the ALT SCHOOL application form. It should link both pages together using global navigation, and the page must be accessible with proper, relevant semantic HTML tags.

   - **Files**: `form.html`


# Assignment 2

Build additional two web pages:

1. **Page 1**: This will be a table about all the courses and schools existing at AltSchool Africa. It should include the School of Engineering (Frontend Engineering, Backend Engineering, Cloud Engineering, Cybersecurity), School of Product (Product Design, Marketing, Management), and School of Data (Data Analysis, Data Science, Data Engineering).

   - **Files**: `table.html`

2. **Page 2**: Use all the media elements existing in HTML to create a powerful message about yourself. Specifically, use the `<picture>` element with more than three sources, with responsiveness for mobile, tablet, and laptop.

   - **Files**: `media.html`
